        In Rust, the return value of the function is synonymous 
        with the value of the final expression in the block of
        the body of a function.

        Define the type of the return value. In the body of the function
        the return values has no semicolon because itâ€™s an expression whose 
        value we want to return.

        Another solution is to write 
            return (num * num); 
        Here we have a semicolon.

    num * num
