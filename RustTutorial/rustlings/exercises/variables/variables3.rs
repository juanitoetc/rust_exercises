    they can be mutable by adding "mut" in front of the variable name.
    Adding "mut" also conveys intent to future readers of the code 
    by indicating that other parts of the code will be changing 
    this variableâ€™s value. When to use? with large data structures, 
    when mutating an instance in place may be faster than copying and 
    returning newly allocated instances.*/
